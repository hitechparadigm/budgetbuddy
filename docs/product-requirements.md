## Vision

AI-powered budgeting app for individuals, couples, families, roommates, and financial advisors.
Web + iOS + Android. Freemium model.

**Core principle**: Users own accounts. Budgets hold financial data. Memberships control access. Subscriptions control paid features.

## Budget Model

### Budget Types

| Type | Transparency | Use case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `personal` | Private — owner only | Individual budgeting |
| `family` | Full — all members see everything, no hidden categories | Couples, households managing finances together |
| `shared` | Limited — only shared expenses | Roommates, in-laws, group trips |

**Family budget rule**: When `budgetType = family`, there are no hidden categories, no private transactions, no per-user visibility filters. Both partners see all income, expenses, debts, savings, and transactions. If a user wants personal spending money, it appears as a visible category (e.g. "Dmytro personal spending: $300/month").

**Personal budget rule**: Cannot have members. Owner can invite Viewers.

### Roles

| Role | Access | Use case |
|------|--------|----------|
| `owner` | Full admin — manage members, archive/delete budget | Budget creator |
| `partner` | Full edit — equal household visibility | Spouse / common-law partner |
| `household_member` | Can add/edit transactions and categories | Adult child, in-law, roommate in a family budget |
| `viewer` | Read-only, optionally time-limited | Financial advisor, accountant, adult child learning |

**Viewer access**: Always plan-specific. Can have `expiresAt` (auto-expires) and `accessLabel` (e.g. "Financial Advisor"). Checked on every API request.

### Multiple Budgets Per User

A user can belong to multiple budgets with different roles in each:
```
Dmytro:
  - Dmytro Personal Budget    → owner
  - Malyk Family Budget        → owner
  - House Shared Budget        → member
  - Client Review Budget       → viewer (expires 2026-08-31)
```

The user's `defaultBudgetId` on their profile determines which budget is active. Users can switch via `PUT /budgets/active`.

---

## Data Model (DynamoDB Single-Table)

```
USER#<userId>
  PROFILE          → { defaultBudgetId, onboardingCompleted, currency, location, subscriptionTier }

BUDGET#<budgetId>
  METADATA         → { budgetId, name, budgetType, ownerUserId, status, currency }
  MEMBER#<userId>  → { role, status, joinedAt, expiresAt, accessLabel, GSI1PK, GSI1SK }
  PERIOD#<YYYY-MM> → { income/savings/expense groups, totals, rolloverIn, rolloverOut }
  ACCOUNT#<id>     → { nickname, accountType, balance }
  TXN#<id>         → { amount, category, date, accountId }
  GOAL#<id>        → { name, targetAmount, currentAmount, targetDate }

INVITATION#<id>
  METADATA         → { budgetId, invitedEmail, role, tokenHash, status, expiresAt, viewerExpiresAt }
```

**GSI1**: `GSI1PK = USER#<userId>` / `GSI1SK = BUDGET#<budgetId>` — lists all budgets a user belongs to.

**GSI4**: `GSI4PK = INVITATION#<email>` — looks up pending invitations by email.

---

## Lambda Access Pattern

Every Lambda that touches budget data:

```javascript
const { userId } = getUserFromEvent(event);
const { budgetId, role, budgetType, budgetStatus, subscriptionTier } =
  await BudgetAccessResolver.resolveAccess(userId, dynamoHelpers, requestedBudgetId);
BudgetAccessResolver.assertPermission(role, action, budgetStatus);
// Read/write BUDGET#<budgetId>/... records
```

`BudgetAccessResolver.resolveAccess()` checks:
1. User profile exists → get `defaultBudgetId`
2. Membership exists and is not revoked/left
3. Viewer `expiresAt` has not passed
4. Budget METADATA exists and is not deleted

---

## Invitation Flow

1. Owner/partner calls `POST /budgets/{budgetId}/invite` with `{ email, role, viewerExpiresAt?, accessLabel? }`
2. Backend generates a 32-byte cryptographically secure token; stores SHA-256 hash in DynamoDB
3. Email sent to invitee with link: `https://app.budgetbuddy.com/budgets/accept?token=<plaintext>`
4. Invitee clicks link → `POST /budgets/accept-invitation` with `{ token }`
5. Backend: validates token hash, checks expiry (7 days), confirms logged-in email matches `invitedEmail`, creates `MEMBER#<userId>` record, marks invitation accepted

**Security rules**: Token is single-use. Tied to one email. Tied to one budget. Tied to one role. Cannot be forwarded to a different email.

---

## Feature Gating

Use `canUseFeature(subscriptionTier, featureKey)` — never check `subscriptionTier` directly.

```javascript
const { canUseFeature } = require('/opt/nodejs/entitlements');
if (!canUseFeature(subscriptionTier, 'budget.export')) {
  throw { statusCode: 403, message: 'This feature requires a premium subscription.' };
}
```

### Feature Catalog (current)

| Feature key | Tier | Description |
|-------------|------|-------------|
| `budget.personal` | free | Personal budget |
| `budget.family` | free | Family budget |
| `budget.shared` | free | Shared budget |
| `budget.ai.generate` | free | AI budget generation |
| `member.invite` | free | Invite budget members |
| `viewer.invite` | free | Invite read-only viewers |
| `viewer.expiry` | free | Set viewer expiration dates |
| `reports.advanced` | premium | Advanced reports |
| `budget.export` | premium | Export budget data |

**Phase 1**: All features are free. The `canUseFeature()` pattern is wired but not enforced yet — this allows Phase 2 to gate features without touching Lambda business logic.

---

## Subscription Tiers (planned)

| Tier | Features |
|------|----------|
| `free` | 1 personal budget, basic AI generation, basic reports |
| `premium` | Multiple budgets, sharing, viewers, advanced reports, export |
| `family_premium` | Premium + covers 5–6 family members, each gets their own private budget |

**Key rule**: Subscription sharing ≠ budget sharing. A family member covered by your subscription gets premium features but does NOT automatically see your budget. Budget access requires an explicit invitation.

**Not yet implemented**: Subscription as a first-class DynamoDB entity. Currently `subscriptionTier` comes from the Cognito JWT claim `custom:subscriptionTier`.

## Implemented Features (✅ Built)

### Core Budget Management
- ✅ Create budget (`POST /budgets`) — supports `personal`, `family`, `shared` types
- ✅ List all budgets for a user (`GET /budgets`) — queries GSI1
- ✅ Switch active budget (`PUT /budgets/active`)
- ✅ Archive / restore / delete budget
- ✅ Monthly budget periods under `BUDGET#<id>/PERIOD#<YYYY-MM>`
- ✅ Zero-based budgeting: `remainingBalance = totalIncome - totalSavings - totalExpenses`
- ✅ Rollover logic (basic — surplus/deficit carries between periods)

### Onboarding
- ✅ AI-powered budget generation from location + household size
- ✅ Budget type selection (personal / family / shared) during onboarding
- ✅ Creates `BUDGET#<id>/METADATA`, `MEMBER#<userId>` (owner), `PERIOD#<month>`, `ACCOUNT#cash` on completion
- ✅ Writes `defaultBudgetId` to user profile
- ⚠️ Gap: onboarding METADATA missing `name` and `ownerUserId` fields

### Membership & Invitations
- ✅ Invite members (`POST /budgets/{id}/invite`) — partner, household_member, viewer
- ✅ Accept invitation (`POST /budgets/accept-invitation`) — token-based, email-tied, single-use
- ✅ Resend invitation (`POST /budgets/{id}/invitations/{id}/resend`)
- ✅ Revoke invitation (`DELETE /budgets/{id}/invitations/{id}`)
- ✅ View pending invitations (`GET /budgets/{id}/invitations`)
- ✅ View members (`GET /budgets/{id}/members`)
- ✅ Update member role (`PUT /budgets/{id}/members/{userId}`)
- ✅ Remove member (`DELETE /budgets/{id}/members/{userId}`)
- ✅ Leave budget (`POST /budgets/{id}/leave`)
- ✅ Extend viewer access (`PUT /budgets/{id}/members/{userId}/extend`)
- ✅ Viewer `expiresAt` enforced on every request via `BudgetAccessResolver`
- ✅ Viewer `accessLabel` (e.g. "Financial Advisor") stored and displayed
- ✅ Personal budgets cannot have members (enforced)
- ✅ Max 1 partner per family budget (enforced)

### Transactions
- ✅ Create, read, update, delete transactions
- ✅ Transactions linked to budget categories and accounts
- ✅ Account selection on transaction entry

### Accounts
- ✅ Manual accounts (Cash, Checking, Savings, etc.)
- ✅ Plaid bank account linking
- ✅ Default Cash account created at onboarding
- ✅ Account management at `/accounts`

### Auth
- ✅ Cognito User Pools + Google OAuth 2.0 (PKCE)
- ✅ JWT carries only `userId` — no budgetId, no role, no familyId
- ✅ `BudgetAccessResolver` resolves budget + role from DynamoDB on every request

### Frontend
- ✅ `BudgetMembersPage` at `/budget/members` — full member management UI
- ✅ Viewer expiry picker (30/60/90 days / no expiry) in invite form
- ✅ Access label input for viewers
- ✅ Member list shows role badges, viewer expiry, access label
- ✅ Extend / Revoke buttons for viewer members
- ✅ Settings page links to `/budget/members` (replaced deprecated FamilySettings)

## Known Gaps (⚠️ Planned)

### High Priority
1. **Onboarding METADATA missing `name` and `ownerUserId`** — budgets created via onboarding don't have a display name. Fix: add `name` (e.g. "My Budget") and `ownerUserId` to the METADATA write in `auth-onboarding/index.js`.

2. **Family budget transparency not enforced at category level** — the vision requires that `family` budgets have no hidden categories. Currently `budgetType` is stored but not used to block per-user category visibility. Fix: add a check in the budget/transaction Lambdas that rejects any attempt to create private/hidden categories on a `family` budget.

3. **`canUseFeature()` not called in Lambda handlers** — the entitlement pattern is wired but Phase 1 intentionally leaves all features open. Phase 2 will add actual gating for `reports.advanced` and `budget.export`.

### Medium Priority
4. **Subscription as a DynamoDB entity** — currently `subscriptionTier` comes from the Cognito JWT claim. Phase 2 needs a `SUBSCRIPTION#<userId>/METADATA` record and a `SubscriptionGroup` entity for family subscription sharing.

5. **Invitation token lookup uses Scan** — `handleAcceptInvitation` scans the table for the hashed token. Works at current scale; needs a GSI on `tokenHash` for production scale.

6. **`shared` budget type has no distinct behavioral rules** — `shared` is accepted and stored but behaves identically to `family` except for the partner limit. The vision specifies shared budgets should only contain shared expenses (no income, no personal debt). This is a product enforcement question, not a data model issue.

### Low Priority
7. **Dark mode missing on BudgetPage, SettingsPage, GoalsPage** — core pages have no `dark:` Tailwind classes.
8. **Edge private window crash** — `BudgetPage` and `TipsFeedPage` call `localStorage` without try/catch; crashes in Edge private mode.
9. **Goals not reflected in budget** — goal contributions don't adjust budget savings categories.
10. **Category A-Z sorting on insert** — display is sorted A-Z but new categories are appended without sorting.
