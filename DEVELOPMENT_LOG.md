## 2025-12-29 - Google Sign-In Authentication Implementation (Session 2)

### Session Summary
**Duration**: 2 hours
**Focus**: Complete Google OAuth 2.0 integration for web, iOS, and Android platforms
**Outcome**: Production-ready Google Sign-In with secure credential management and cross-platform support

### Accomplishments

- ✅ **Google OAuth 2.0 Implementation** (1 hour)
  - Fixed expo-auth-session v7 API compatibility (replaced deprecated startAsync with openAuthSessionAsync)
  - Implemented PKCE flow with proper code verifier generation and base64url encoding
  - Created GoogleAuthService with secure token exchange and user info fetching
  - Added platform-specific OAuth client ID support (web, iOS, Android)
  - Implemented secure token storage using Expo SecureStore (iOS Keychain/Android Keystore)

- ✅ **UI Integration & Components** (0.5 hours)
  - Created GoogleSignInButton component with loading states and platform variants
  - Integrated Google Sign-In button into LoginScreen with divider
  - Added Google Sign-In handler with error handling and user feedback
  - Extended auth service with signInWithGoogle, linkGoogleAccount, unlinkGoogleAccount methods

- ✅ **Configuration & Security** (0.5 hours)
  - Updated google.ts config with environment variable support for all platforms
  - Created .env.local with all Google OAuth credentials
  - Stored credentials in AWS Secrets Manager (budgetbuddy-dev/google-oauth)
  - Created comprehensive GOOGLE_SIGNIN_SETUP.md documentation

### Issues Encountered & Resolutions

1. **Java/keytool Not Installed**
   - Issue: Could not generate SHA-1 fingerprint using keytool
   - Resolution: Used EAS credentials system instead (recommended approach)
   - Outcome: Successfully obtained Android and iOS client IDs from Google Cloud Console

2. **Expo Auth Session API Changes**
   - Issue: startAsync method not available in expo-auth-session v7
   - Resolution: Updated to use openAuthSessionAsync from expo-web-browser
   - Outcome: Proper OAuth flow working on all platforms

3. **Type Errors in Google Auth Service**
   - Issue: WebBrowser result type incompatibility
   - Resolution: Fixed type checking for 'dismiss' vs 'error' result types
   - Outcome: All TypeScript errors resolved, code compiles cleanly

### Technical Details

**Credentials Configured:**
- Web: Stored in AWS Secrets Manager (never commit to code)
- iOS: Stored in AWS Secrets Manager (never commit to code)
- Android: Stored in AWS Secrets Manager (never commit to code)

**AWS Secrets Manager:**
